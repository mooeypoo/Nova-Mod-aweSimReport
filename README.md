# aweSimReport LITE for Nova2

So, after much begging and requests, I decided to release a smaller version of the once-large-and-lovely aweSimReport for Nova2.

This is a very stripped-down version, meant to save GMs time by doing the log report counts for them. 
If I have some more time, I will work on expanding this edition for the future.

For the moment, the result is printed on a new blank page where you can copy/paste the results into an email.

## Install
I took great care to make sure the install is as easy as possible. All files in this edition are completely standalone, which means all you need to do is upload the "application" folder **as-is**.

Enjoy. 

## Bug Reports
If you find any, or have any special requests, please use the 'issues' tab. Please take into account I'm a graduate student with very little time. I'll be doing my very very best to answer bugs and requests, but be patient with me.

## Credit
This is an extension for Anodyne Nova RPG system. It is absolutely free to use. I'd appreciate it if you keep my name in the credits, and notify me if you create any cool changes or additions so I can add them here.
